## Landing Page Description
This landing page is for the National Art Museum of Ukraine (NAMU). 
It provides information about the museum's current exhibitions, events, and operational details. 
The page features various exhibitions, upcoming events, gallery images, and a subscription form to keep visitors updated on the latest news and events.

## What I learned
 #### Responsive Design: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts.
 #### Sass: Structuring styles with the preprocessor for better code organization and reuse.
 #### Animations and Interactions: Implementing pseudo-elements and transitions for smooth animations.
